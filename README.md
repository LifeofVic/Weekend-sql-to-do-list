# SQL TO DO LIST

## Description
The task for our weekend project was to build an app where the user can input tasks that are saved to a list to do. This To-Do list will gather the tasks provided by the user, which will allow them to mark off when completed or delete when needed. In order for me to create this app, I had to gather the data from the user from the input fields provided to them. With the data already saved to the database I will then have to store the id value in order to know which function of complete or delete the task was given. Doing so will allow me to provide the appropriate visual to the user if the task is complete or removed from the list.
